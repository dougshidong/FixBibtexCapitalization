The block lowerâupper symmetric GaussâSeidel (LU-SGS) and hybrid {R}ungeâ{K}utta/LU-SGS schemes are implemented in Bombardierâs multiblock {Navier}â{Stokes} solver, FANSC. The schemes are compared to the existing {R}ungeâ{K}utta and point-Jacobi preconditioned explicit multistage smoothers. Through tests ranging from 2D airfoils to 3D wing-body-engine cases, the computational speed-up and robustness of the implicit schemes are evaluated. It is shown that the implicit smoothers present a computational speed-up of at least two, and are significantly more robust, especially for flow problems involving the âpower-onâ engine boundary condition.},

Detailed discussions also include the extension to p.d.e.'s, the construction of the adjoint p.d.e. and its boundary conditions, and the physical significance of the adjoint solution.

  abstract = {Reduced-space inexact-Newton--Krylov (RSNK) algorithms provide a modular and scalable framework for solving differential-equation-constrained optimization problems; thus, this class of algorithms provides an attractive compromise between poorly scaling ``black-box'' methods and more intrusive, full-space optimization algorithms. One of the challenges of implementing RSNK methods is the efficient solution of the linear subproblems, which involve the reduced {Hessian}. This paper explores inexact {Hessian}-vector products to improve the efficiency of these subproblems. The reduced-{Hessian}-vector products, which are required by the Krylov solver in RSNK, can be determined by solving two second-order adjoint equations. To reduce computational cost, we consider the approximate (i.e.Â inexact) solution of the second-order adjoints. We present bounds for the second-order adjoint tolerances that ensure the {Hessian}-vector product remains sufficiently accurate for inexact-Krylov methods. The bounds involve the 2-norm of the state and first-order adjoint sensitivities, and we provide an inexpensive Lanczos algorithm to estimate these matrix norms. Using numerical experiments, we investigate the proposed RSNK algorithm and compare it to other optimization algorithms.},

  abstract = {Abstract The concept of isogeometric analysis is proposed. Basis functions generated from {NURBS} (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are employed to construct an exact geometric model. For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advectionâdiffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages.},

  abstract = {Gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and time dependent problems in aeroelasticity, that is, coupled calculations between computational structural mechanics (CSM) and CFD, require repeated deformations of the CFD mesh. An interpolation scheme, based on radial basis functions (RBF), is devised in order to propagate the deformations from the boundaries to the interior of the CFD mesh. This method can lower the computational costs due to the deformation of the mesh, in comparison with the usual Laplace smoothing. Moreover, the algorithm is independent of the mesh connectivities. Therefore, structured and unstructured meshes are equally treated as well as hybrid meshes. The application of this interpolation scheme in problems of aerodynamic shape optimization is also carefully investigated. When the optimization is executed by a gradient-based algorithm the cost function is differentiated with respect to the design parameters in order to obtain the gradient. The gradient is most efficiently and accurately calculated by solving a certain adjoint equation derived from the discretized flow equations. The calculation of the gradient, which is detailed in this presentation, involves the Jacobian matrix of the mesh deformation. Finally, we present the results of an optimization of the ONERA M6 wing at transonic speed using the interpolation algorithm. The results are used for comparison with another technique of mesh deformation. The quality of the mesh obtained by the new algorithm, and the interpolation error, are analyzed with respect to the parameters of the interpolation scheme: the type of RBF, the RBFâs shape parameter, and the sets of control points.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the formulation of optimization techniques based on control theory for aerodynamic shape design in viscous compressible flow, modeled by the {Navier}--{Stokes} equations. It extends previous work on optimization for inviscid flow. The theory is applied to a system defined by the partial differential equations of the flow, with the boundary shape acting as the control. The Fréchet derivative of the cost function is determined via the solution of an adjoint partial differential equation, and the boundary shape is then modified in a direction of descent. This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached. Each design cycle requires the numerical solution of both the flow and the adjoint equations, leading to a computational cost roughly equal to the cost of two flow solutions. The cost is kept low by using multigrid techniques, in conjunction with preconditioning to accelerate the convergence of the solutions. The power of the method is illustrated by designs of wings and wing--body combinations for long range transport aircraft. Satisfactory designs are usually obtained with 20--40 design cycles.},

  abstract = {The continuing evolution of supercomputers is shifting the optimal tradeoff between computational costs and completeness of the mathematical model toward the solution of the full set of nonlinear conservation laws. During the last decade the development of effective methods for solving the inviscid form of the conservation laws has provided the necessary framework for attempting the analysis of viscous flows by solving the compressible {Navier}-{Stokes} and Reynolds averaged equations. The present work carries out this extension for 2-D transonic viscous flows past airfoils. Two multigrid schemes for the solution of the 2-D viscous compressible conservation equations were developed and validated. A finite volume formulation was used to discretize the spatial operators, and several discretization formulas for the viscous terms are studied. Several examples of applications to the Reynolds averaged equations in the transonic regime are presented and discussed. For these computations, closure was achieved by using a simple algebraic turbulence model widely accepted in computational aerodynamics. The validation of two efficient, robust, and accurate multigrid methods brings numerical simulation of the {Navier}-{Stokes} and Reynolds averaged equations to a new plateau. The combination of accuracy and speed provides a necessary tool for the study of turbulence modeling for aerodynamic flow, by making it possible to obtain a rapid and reliable assessment of the effects of substituting alternative models.},

The aero-structural analysis uses high-fidelity models of both the aerodynamics and the structures. Aero-structural sensitivities are computed using a coupled-adjoint approach that is based on previously developed single discipline sensitivity analysis. Alternative strategies for coupled sensitivity analysis are also discussed. The aircraft geometry and a structure of fixed topology are parameterized using a large number of design variables. The aero-structural sensitivities of aerodynamic and structural functions with respect to these design variables are computed and compared with results given by the complex-step derivative approximation. The coupled-adjoint procedure is shown to yield very accurate sensitivities and to be computationally efficient, making high-fidelity aero-structural design feasible for problems with thousands of design variables.},

  abstract = {A novel continuous adjoint approach for the computation of the second order sensitivities of the objective function used in inverse design problems is proposed. In the framework of the Newton method, the proposed approach can be used to efficiently cope with inverse design problems in viscous flows, where the target is a given pressure distribution along the solid walls. It consists of two steps and will, thus, be referred to as the direct-adjoint approach. At the first step, the direct differentiation method is used to compute the first order sensitivities of the flow variables with respect to the design variables and build the gradient of the objective function. At the second step, the adjoint approach is used to compute the second order sensitivities. The final {Hessian} expression is free of field integrals and its computation requires the solution of N + 1 equivalent flow (system) solutions for N design variables. Since the CPU cost of using the Newton method, with exact gradient and {Hessian} data at each cycle, becomes prohibitively high, an approach that computes the exact {Hessian} only once and then updates it in an approximated manner through the BFGS formula, is used instead. The accuracy of the {Hessian} matrix components, computed using the direct-adjoint approach is demonstrated on the inverse design of a diffuser and a cascade airfoil.},

Four new formulations based on all possible combinations of the direct differentiation method and the continuous adjoint approach to compute the sensitivity derivatives of objective functions, constrained by the flow equations, are presented. They are compared in terms of the expected CPU cost to compute the {Hessian} of the objective function used in single-objective optimization problems with N degrees of freedom. The less costly among them was selected for further study and tested in inverse design problems solved by means of the Newton method. The selected approach, which will be referred to as the directâadjoint one, since it performs direct differentiation for the gradient and, then, uses the adjoint approach to compute the {Hessian}, requires as many as N + 2 equivalent flow solutions for each Newton step. The major part of the CPU cost (N equivalent flow solutions) is for the computation of the gradient but, fortunately, this task is directly amenable to parallelization. The method is used to reconstruct ducts or cascade airfoils for a known pressure distribution along their solid boundaries, at inviscid flow conditions. The examined cases aim at demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed method in computing the exact {Hessian} matrix as well as the efficiency of the exact Newton method as an optimization tool in aerodynamic design.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on discrete and continuous adjoint approaches and direct differentiation methods that can efficiently be used in aerodynamic shape optimization problems. The advantage of the adjoint approach is the computation of the gradient of the objective function at cost which does not depend upon the number of design variables. An extra advantage of the formulation presented below, for the computation of either first or second order sensitivities, is that the resulting sensitivity expressions are free of field integrals even if the objective function is a field integral. This is demonstrated using three possible objective functions for use in internal aerodynamic problems; the first objective is for inverse design problems where a target pressure distribution along the solid walls must be reproduced; the other two quantify viscous losses in duct or cascade flows, cast as either the reduction in total pressure between the inlet and outlet or the field integral of entropy generation. From the mathematical point of view, the three functions are defined over different parts of the domain or its boundaries, and this strongly affects the adjoint formulation. In the second part of this paper, the same discrete and continuous adjoint formulations are combined with direct differentiation methods to compute the {Hessian} matrix of the objective function. Although the direct differentiation for the computation of the gradient is time consuming, it may support the adjoint method to calculate the exact {Hessian} matrix components with the minimum CPU cost. Since, however, the CPU cost is proportional to the number of design variables, a well performing optimization scheme, based on the exactly computed {Hessian} during the starting cycle and a quasi Newton (BFGS) scheme during the next cycles, is proposed.},

  abstract = {The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach to high-order methods is a flexible and robust framework that has proven to be a promising alternative to the traditional Discontinuous {G}alerkin (DG) schemes on parallel architectures like Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) since it pairs exceptionally well with explicit time-stepping methods. The FR formulation was originally proposed by Huynh (AIAA Pap 2007-4079:1--42, 2007). Vincent et al. (J Sci Comput 47(1):50--72, 2011) later developed a single parameter family of correction functions which provide energy stable schemes under this formulation in 1D. These schemes, known as Vincent--Castonguay--Jameson--Huynh (VCJH) schemes, offer control over properties like stability, dispersion and dissipation through the variation of the VCJH parameter. Classical schemes like nodal-DG and Spectral Difference (SD) can also be recovered under this formulation. Following the development of the FR approach in 1D, Castonguay et al. (J Sci Comput 51(1):224--256, 2012) and Williams et al. (J Comput Phys 250:53--76, 2013) and Williams and Jameson (J Sci Comput 59(3):721--759, 2014) developed correction functions that give rise to energy stable FR formulations for triangles and tetrahedra. For the case of tensor product elements like quadrilaterals and hexahedra however, a simple extension of the 1D FR approach utilizing the 1D VCJH correction functions was possible and has been adopted by several authors (Castonguay in High-order energy stable flux reconstruction schemes for fluid flow simulations on unstructured grids, 2012; Witherden et al. in Comput Fluids 120:173--186, 2015; Comput Phys Commun 185(11):3028--3040, 2014). But whether such an extension of the 1D approach to tensor product elements is stable remained an open question. A direct extension of the 1D stability analysis fails due to certain key difficulties which necessitate the formulation of a norm different from the one utilized for stability analysis in 1D and on simplex elements. We have recently overcome these issues and shown that the VCJH schemes are stable for the linear advection equation on Cartesian meshes for any non-negative value of the VCJH parameter (Sheshadri and Jameson in J Sci Comput 67(2):769--790, 2016; J Sci Comput 67(2):791--794, 2016). In this paper, we have extended the stability analysis to the advection--diffusion equation, demonstrating that the tensor product FR formulation is stable on Cartesian meshes for the advection--diffusion case as well. The analysis in this paper also provides additional insights into the dependence on the VCJH parameter of the diffusion and stability characteristics of these schemes. Several numerical experiments that support the theoretical results are included.},

Each flow solution in the optimization loop is computed on a sequence of goal-oriented h-refined or hp-refined meshes until the error estimation of the discretization error in a flow-related target quantity (including the drag and lift coefficients) is below a prescribed tolerance. Discrete adjoint solutions are computed and employed for the multi-target error estimation and adaptive mesh refinement. Furthermore, discrete adjoint solutions are employed for evaluating the gradients of the objective function used in the CGs optimization algorithm. Furthermore, an extension of the adjoint-based gradient evaluation to the case of target lift flow computations is employed. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on an inviscid transonic flow around the RAE2822, where the shape is optimized to minimize the drag at a given constant lift and airfoil thickness. The effect of the accuracy of the underlying flow solutions on the quality of the optimized airfoil shapes is investigated. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {An isogeometric discontinuous {G}alerkin method for {Euler} equations is proposed. It integrates the idea of isogeometric analysis with the discontinuous {G}alerkin framework by constructing each element through the knots insertion and degree elevation techniques in non-uniform rational B-splines. This leads to the solution inherently shares the same function space as the non-uniform rational B-splines representation, and results in that the curved boundaries as well as the interfaces between neighboring elements are naturally and exactly resolved. Additionally, the computational cost is reduced in contrast to that of structured grid generation. Numerical tests demonstrate that the presented method can be high order of accuracy and flexible in handling curved geometry. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The objective of this paper is to compare three optimization-based methods for solving aerodynamic design problems. We use the {Euler} equations for one-dimensional duct flow as a model problem. The optimization methods are (i) the black-box method with finite difference gradients, (ii) a modification where gradients are found by an algorithm based on the implicit function theorem, and (iii) an all-atonce method where the flow and design variables are simultaneously altered. The three methods are applied to the model problem and compared for efficiency, robustness, and implementation difficulty. We also show that the black-box (implicit gradient) method is equivalent to applying the ?variational? or ?optimal control? approach to design optimization directly to the discretized analysis problem, rather than to the continuous problem as is usually done. The black-box method with implicit gradients seems to provide a good compromise of features, and can be retrofitted to most existing analysis codes to turn them into design codes. Although the all-at-once method was found to be less robust than the black-box methods, when it succeeded it was considerably more efficient.},

  abstract    = {This paper introduces a computational scheme for solving a class of aerodynamic design problems that can be posed as nonlinear equality constrained optimizations. The scheme treats the flow and design variables as independent variables, and solves the constrained optimization problem via reduced {Hessian} successive quadratic programming. It updates the design and flow variables simultaneously at each iteration and allows flow variables to be infeasible before convergence. The solution of an adjoint flow equation is never needed. In addition, a range space basis is chosen so that in a certain sense the "cross term" ignored in reduced {Hessian} {SQP} methods is minimized. Numerical results for a nozzle design using the quasi-one-dimensional {Euler} equations show that this scheme is computationally efficient and robust. The computational cost of a typical nozzle design is only a fraction more than that of the corresponding analysis flow calculation. superlinear convergence is also observed, which agrees with the theoretical properties of this scheme. All optimal solutions are obtained by starting far away from the final solution.},

Phys. 367  (2018), pp 166-191], we proposed a new type of  troubled-cell indicator to detect discontinuities in the  numerical solutions of one-dimensional conservation laws.  This was achieved by suitably training an articial neural  network on canonical local solution structures for  conservation laws. The proposed indicator was independent  of problem-dependent parameters, giving it an advantage  over existing limiter-based indicators. In the present  paper, we extend this approach to train a similar network  capable of detecting troubled-cells on two-dimensional  unstructured grids. The proposed network has a smaller  architecture compared to its one-dimensional predecessor,  making it computationally efficient. Several numerical  results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the  new indicator.},

  abstract      = {Global aerodynamic design optimization using Euler or Navier-Stokes equations requires very reliable surrogate modeling techniques since the computational effort for the underlying flow simulations is usually high. In general, for such problems, the number of samples that can be generated to train the surrogate models is very limited due to restricted computational resources. On the other hand, recent developments in adjoint methods enable nowadays evaluation of gradient information at a reasonable computational cost for a wide variety of engineering problems. Therefore, a much richer data set can be collected using an adjoint solver in a Design of Experiment framework. In the present work, we present a novel aggregation method, which enables the state of the art surrogate models to incorporate extra gradient information without causing overfitting problems. Therefore, accurate surrogate models with relatively large number of design parameters can be trained from a small set of samples. We also present results two well known benchmark design optimization problems showing efficiency and robustness of the new method.},

  abstract  = {This dissertation presents the development of a novel immersogeometric method for the simulation of turbulent compressible flows around complex geometries. The immersogeometric analysis is first extended into the version of tetrahedral finite cell method, in order to handle complex geometries flexibly and accurately. The developed method immerses complex objects into non-boundary-fitted meshes of tetrahedral finite elements which can be easily refined in interesting regions. Adaptively-refined quadrature rules faithfully capture the flow domain geometry in the discrete problem without modifying the non-boundary-fitted finite element mesh. Particular emphasis is placed on studying the importance of the geometry resolution in in- tersected elements. Aligning with the immersogeometric concept, the results show that the faithful representation of the geometry in intersected elements is critical for accurate flow analysis. To simulate the compressible flows in an accurate and and robust way, a novel stabilized finite element formulation is developed. New weak imposition of essential boundary conditions and sliding-interface formulations are also proposed in the context of moving-domain compressible flows. The new formulation is successfully tested on a set of examples spanning a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers showing its superior robustness. Experimental validation of the new formulation is also carried out with good success. The developments of tetrahedral finite cell method and the stabilized finite element formulations are combined to further develop the immersogeometric method for compressible flows. Non-symmetric Nitsche method is used in the weak-boundary-condition operator, to offer good performance in the context of non-boundary-fitted discretization. The developed immersogeometric method is tested against several benchmark problems, to prove its comparable accuracy to its boundary-fitted counterpart. Finally, the aerodynamic analysis of a UH-60 helicopter is carried outusing the developed method, to illustrate its potential to support design of real engineering systems through high-fidelity aerodynamic analysis.},

  abstract  = {This dissertation presents two novel contributions to the fields of isogeometric analysis and p-version finite elements. First, we present a framework for geometrically exact volumetric mesh generation. By leveraging ideas from both traditional mesh generation as well as isogeometric analysis, we develop a framework for volumetric mesh generation using rational Bernstein--Bezier discretizations. Within this framework, we provide a set of easily verifiable sufficient conditions for guaranteeing that a mesh will be geometrically exact. Second, we develop a complete theory of mesh quality for these rational Bernstein--B\'{e}zier elements. From this, we derive a set of easily computable mesh quality metrics for verifying that a rational Bernstein--Bezier discretization will be analysis suitable.},

  abstract      = {High order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for nonlinear conservation laws satisfy an inherent discrete entropy inequality. The construction of such schemes has relied on the use of carefully chosen nodal points or volume and surface quadrature rules to produce operators which satisfy a summation-by-parts (SBP) property. In this work, we show how to construct "modal" skew-symmetric DG formulations which are entropy stable for volume and surface quadratures under which a traditional SBP property does not hold. These skew-symmetric formulations avoid the use of a "strong" matrix-based SBP property, and instead rely on the assumption that discrete operators exactly differentiate constants and satisfy a discrete form of the fundamental theorem of calculus. We conclude with numerical experiments verifying the accuracy and stability of the proposed formulations, and discuss an application of skew-symmetric formulations for entropy stable DG schemes on mixed quadrilateral-triangle meshes.},

  abstract      = {In many optimization problems arising from scientific, engineering and artificial intelligence applications, objective and constraint functions are available only as the output of a black-box or simulation oracle that does not provide derivative information. Such settings necessitate the use of methods for derivative-free, or zeroth-order, optimization. We provide a review and perspectives on developments in these methods, with an emphasis on highlighting recent developments and on unifying treatment of such problems in the non-linear optimization and machine learning literature. We categorize methods based on assumed properties of the black-box functions, as well as features of the methods. We first overview the primary setting of deterministic methods applied to unconstrained, non-convex optimization problems where the objective function is defined by a deterministic black-box oracle. We then discuss developments in randomized methods, methods that assume some additional structure about the objective (including convexity, separability and general non-smooth compositions), methods for problems where the output of the black-box oracle is stochastic, and methods for handling different types of constraints.},

The noise is assumed to be bounded in absolute value without any additional assumptions. We extend the framework based on stochastic methods from [Cartis and Scheinberg, 2018] which was developed to provide analysis of a standard line search method with exact function values and random gradients to the case of noisy function. We introduce a condition on the gradient which when satisfied with some sufficiently large probability at each iteration, guarantees convergence properties of the line search method. We derive expected complexity bounds for convex, strongly convex and nonconvex functions.},

  month         = dec,
  abstract      = {A novel framework for resolving discontinuous solutions of conservation laws, e.g., contact lines, shock waves, and interfaces, using implicit tracking and a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization was introduced in [38]. Central to the framework is an optimization problem whose solution is a discontinuity-aligned mesh and the corresponding high-order approximation to the flow that does not require explicit meshing of the unknown discontinuity surface. The method was shown to deliver highly accurate solutions on coarse, high-order discretizations without nonlinear stabilization and recover optimal convergence rates even for problems with discontinuous solutions. This work extends the implicit tracking framework such that robustness is improved and convergence accelerated. In particular, we introduce an improved formulation of the central optimization problem and an associated sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solver. The new error-based objective function penalizes violation of the DG residual in an enriched test space and is shown to have excellent tracking properties. The SQP solver simultaneously converges the nodal coordinates of the mesh and DG solution to their optimal values and is equipped with a number of features to ensure robust, fast convergence: Levenberg-Marquardt approximation of the Hessian with weighted elliptic regularization, backtracking line search, and rigorous convergence criteria. We use the proposed method to solve a range of inviscid conservation laws of varying difficulty. We show the method is able to deliver accurate solutions on coarse, high-order meshes and the SQP solver is robust and usually able to drive the first-order optimality system to tight tolerances.},

The high-order operators are applied without forming the system matrix, making use of sum factorization for efficient evaluation. The system is preconditioned using a spectrally equivalent low-order finite element operator discretization on a refined mesh. The low-order refined mesh is anisotropic and not shape regular in $p$, requiring specialized solvers to treat the anisotropy. We make use of a structured, geometric multigrid V-cycle with ordered ILU(0) smoothing. The preconditioner is parallelized through an overlapping additive Schwarz method that is robust in $h$ and $p$. The method is extended to interior penalty and BR2 discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, for which it is also robust in the size of the penalty parameter. Numerical results are presented on a variety of examples, verifying the uniformity of the preconditioner.},

  title    = {Tangent and adjoint problems in partially converged flows},
  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {Adjoint methods see widespread use in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in two important domains of
the field: shape optimization and output-based refinement. CFD has become more widespread as computing
power has become more available and algorithms have become both more advanced and efficient. This allows
for the use of cheap, low-fidelity methods in the conceptual design stage, and more accurate high-fidelity
methods later in the detailed design stage. The high fidelity methods coupled with optimization toolboxes
for automated design have a significant place in the detailed design process, mainly to better inform the use
of expensive wind tunnel testing. Furthermore, the use of adjoint methods in shape optimization allows for
cheaper sensitivity evaluation for gradient-based design approaches, allowing for scaling independent of the
number of design variables. As a result highly refined/parameterized design optimizations are possible with
negligible cost increases.
Adjoint methods are also utilized in the context of adaptive mesh refinement as they can be used to
create output-based error estimates. Adjoint-based methods form an error estimate that calculates error in
the output-of-interest, and are desirable for their efficacy in tailoring/adapting meshes for maximum accuracy
in the engineering quantity of interest. This can allow for coarsening meshes in areas of little engineering
interest and refining in areas of high interest, thus resulting in a maximally useful mesh for engineering
quantities with a given number of degrees of freedom.
The adjoint systems used in these analyses require that the nonlinear problem be solved to machine
precision that the discretized form of the governing equations be satisfied. However, as the field has
attempted more difficult simulations either due to the accuracy of spatial discretization of the simulation,
the geometry of the model, or the increasing push to unsteady flow, it has become increasingly difficult
to satisfy this constraint. Some members of the field have demonstrated that this can lead to difficult to
converge adjoint problems that provide sensitivities highly dependent on the state at which the simulation
is terminated. Additionally, this can lead to issues with the error estimation process by returning inaccurate
error estimates and poor refinement patterns.
This work develops a novel methodology for adjoint based optimization and error estimation for un-
converged simulations through linearization of the nonlinear solution process. It contains results for various
different nonlinear solvers and applications of the adjoint system to design optimization and error estimation.
As CFD has been used for more complex simulations (unsteady, high-order, complex geometry) the ability
to get a useful adjoint solution that is guaranteed to not diverge is tremendously desirable. The goal of
this work is to show a hierarchy of different linearizations with different approximations and apply them
to these partially converged problems. This work presents tangent and adjoint formulations for each of the
various nonlinear solution strategies used in the test cases, including the solution strategies required to avoid
flow divergence for problems with strong shocks. It also shows the varying linear solver technologies, used in the nonlinear process, the mesh deformation process, and the tangent and adjoint processes. Included
also are three different error estimation techniques for the steady state adjoint and their analogues for the
pseudo-time accurate adjoint. These error estimation techniques are used to drive mesh adaptation and
the algorithms for the adaptive mesh refinement package are included as well. A detailed error analysis of
approximate linearization of the nonlinear solution process for both the tangent and adjoint modes is shown
as well. The end result is a series of methods and algorithms guaranteed to provide either adjoint based
sensitivities or adjoint based error estimates that are insensitive to the specific state of termination of the
solution process and can be useful for simulations which do not fully converge, where the calculation of
accurate sensitivities has been a major stumbling block to date.},

  abstract      = {Neural network training relies on our ability to find "good" minimizers of highly non-convex loss functions. It is well-known that certain network architecture designs (e.g., skip connections) produce loss functions that train easier, and well-chosen training parameters (batch size, learning rate, optimizer) produce minimizers that generalize better. However, the reasons for these differences, and their effects on the underlying loss landscape, are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of neural loss functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on generalization, using a range of visualization methods. First, we introduce a simple "filter normalization" method that helps us visualize loss function curvature and make meaningful side-by-side comparisons between loss functions. Then, using a variety of visualizations, we explore how network architecture affects the loss landscape, and how training parameters affect the shape of minimizers.},

  abstract      = {Recent work has attempted to interpret residual networks (ResNets) as one step of a forward Euler discretization of an ordinary differential equation, focusing mainly on syntactic algebraic similarities between the two systems. Discrete dynamical integrators of continuous dynamical systems, however, have a much richer structure. We first show that ResNets fail to be meaningful dynamical integrators in this richer sense. We then demonstrate that neural network models can learn to represent continuous dynamical systems, with this richer structure and properties, by embedding them into higher-order numerical integration schemes, such as the Runge Kutta schemes. Based on these insights, we introduce ContinuousNet as a continuous-in-depth generalization of ResNet architectures. ContinuousNets exhibit an invariance to the particular computational graph manifestation. That is, the continuous-in-depth model can be evaluated with different discrete time step sizes, which changes the number of layers, and different numerical integration schemes, which changes the graph connectivity. We show that this can be used to develop an incremental-in-depth training scheme that improves model quality, while significantly decreasing training time. We also show that, once trained, the number of units in the computational graph can even be decreased, for faster inference with little-to-no accuracy drop.},

All of this appears to call for a full batch approach, but since small batch sizes give rise to faster algorithms with better generalization properties, L-BFGS is currently not considered an algorithm of choice for large-scale machine learning applications. One need not, however, choose between the two extremes represented by the full batch or highly stochastic regimes, and may instead follow a progressive batching approach in which the sample size increases during the course of the optimization. In this paper, we present a new version of the L-BFGS algorithm that combines three basic components - progressive batching, a stochastic line search, and stable quasi-Newton updating - and that performs well on training logistic regression and deep neural networks. We provide supporting convergence theory for the method.},

The inclusion of bound constraints for the control poses a significant additional challenge for optimization methods. In this paper, we propose preconditioners for the saddle point problems that arise when a primal-dual active set method is used. We also show for this method that the same saddle point system can be derived when the method is considered as a semismooth Newton method. In addition, the projected gradient method can be employed to solve optimization problems with simple bounds, and we discuss the efficient solution of the linear systems in question. In the case when an acceleration technique is employed for the projected gradient method, this again yields a semismooth Newton method that is equivalent to the primal-dual active set method. We also consider the Moreau-Yosida regularization method for control constraints and efficient preconditioners for this technique. Numerical results illustrate the competitiveness of these approaches.},

  abstract      = {A longstanding open problem asks for an aperiodic monotile, also known as an "einstein": a shape that admits tilings of the plane, but never periodic tilings. We answer this problem for topological disk tiles by exhibiting a continuum of combinatorially equivalent aperiodic polygons. We first show that a representative example, the "hat" polykite, can form clusters called "metatiles", for which substitution rules can be defined. Because the metatiles admit tilings of the plane, so too does the hat. We then prove that generic members of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of geometric incommensurability argument. Separately, we give a combinatorial, computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical -- and hence aperiodic -- tilings.},

  abstract = {We present hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving steady and time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in continuum mechanics. The essential ingredients are a local Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the numerical trace; a judicious choice of the numerical flux to provide stability and consistency; and a global jump condition that enforces the continuity of the numerical flux to arrive at a global weak formulation in terms of the numerical trace. The HDG methods are fully implicit, high-order accurate and endowed with several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the solution on element boundaries, thereby leading to a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, they provide, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of all the variables which converge with the optimal order of k+1 in the L2-norm. Third, they possess some superconvergence properties that allow us to define inexpensive element-by-element postprocessing procedures to compute a new approximate solution which may converge with higher order than the original solution. And fourth, they allow for a novel and systematic way for imposing boundary conditions for the total stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the methods. In addition, they possess other interesting properties for specific problems. Their approximate solution can be postprocessed to yield an exactly divergence-free and H(div)-conforming velocity field for incompressible flows. They do not exhibit volumetric locking for nearly incompressible solids. We provide extensive numerical results to illustrate their distinct characteristics and compare their performance with that of continuous Galerkin methods.},
