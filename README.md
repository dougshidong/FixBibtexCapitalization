# FixBibtexCapitalization

This script will ensure that words you have capitalize and want to keep capitalized in your bibtex file will stay capitalized by surrounding it with curly braces {}.

The list of proctected words are controlled through `protected_word_list.py`.

Please backup your .bib file, I am not responsible if you mess it up.

`python3 fix_bibliography_titles.py`
gives the output below and output a new .bib output with fixed Title entries. The output below is meant for review of what has changed.
